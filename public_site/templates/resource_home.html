          The LTEC team has developed several resources throughout the LTEC project. These resources include: (1) Learning Trajectories for the following computational concepts: Sequence, Repetition, Conditionals, Decomposition, and Debugging .(2) Lesson plans for integrated fractions + CT that we are calling Action Fractions, and (3) Videos, presentations and publications that describe the project in depth.

        <h2>Learning Trajectories</h2>
        <p>
          Explore our draft learning trajectories, published in SIGCSE and ICER. Gray boxes indicate concepts that could be learned and applied outside of computing, whereas white boxes refer to computing specifically. Developed based on over 100 CS Ed publications, these are just a starting point. As with any LTâ€™s, these are potential learning paths a student can follow or a curriculum designed around. However, some students may learn later concepts before earlier ones, or jump around. The arrows should be interpreted as suggestions, not definite pronouncements.

        <h2>LTEC-2: Action Fractions Lessons</h2>
        <p>
          Action Fractions is a cohesive sequence of activities designed to align with math standards for fraction instruction in 3rd and 4th grade as well as CT learning goals drawn from learning trajectories for sequence, conditionals, iteration, and debugging.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          Action Fraction lessons can be divided into three categories: unplugged, skill building and culminating project. Each year of instruction includes approximately 12 activities. Major concepts are often introduced first in an unplugged activity, followed by several skill building activities. Each year concludes with an open-ended, culminating project.
          Most skill-building lessons follow a similar format. First, the context is set in the mathematics context and the CT context. Next, students are presented with example code that illustrates the use of a CT concept for exploring a mathematics concept. Students are stepped through the example code in three steps using the TIPP&SEE learning strategy: observing how it currently works, inspecting the code and predicting what code blocks had particular effects, then making small changes to new code blocks in order to better understand the code. Then the students use those code blocks to make their own scripts according to prompts in journal pages.

        <h2>LTEC-1: Initial CT+Math Lessons</h2>
        <p>
          Originally created by teachers at Kenwood Elementary in the Champaign Unit Four School District with the support of faculty from the University of Illinois, these original lessons were intended for use with the Everyday Math 4 curriculum in grades 1-5 . The lessons were later iterated upon by Judy Rocke for the purpose of more widespread distribution.
